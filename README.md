# Climate Analysis and App Creation


Objective:  Conduct a climate analysis to help plan for a trip to Honolulu, Hawaii.

Step 1: Climate Analysis and Exploration
* Precipitation Analysis - Retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data, calculate the summary statistics and plot the results.
* Station Analysis - Calculate the total number of weather stations, find the most active stations, retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observations
   from the most active station and plot in a histogram.

Step 2:  Climate App
* Design a Flask API based on the queries from Step1; include the following routes:
   * Home - list all available routes
   * Precipitation - list precipitation results for past 12 months
   * Stations - list of all weather stations
   * Tobs - list temperature observations of most active station for past 12 months
   * Start Date - list minimum, maximum, and average temperature for all dates greater than and equal to start date
   * Start/End Date - list minimum, maximum, and average temperature for all dates between (inclusive) of start and end dates
